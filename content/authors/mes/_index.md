I am currently in my second year of the CS Bachelor programme at the ZHAW. My interests include core CS topics, using computers in finance and bioinformatics. I'm also interested in the development of promising of ideas into enterprises.
When I'm not in front of a computer I love spending time on my bike, in my running shoes or playing the violin.
