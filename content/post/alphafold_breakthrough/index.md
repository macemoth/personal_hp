Electron density of Myoglobin, the first protein which structure was imaged using X-Ray crystallography, which was another leap.

As I started this site (which is also when I became interested in Bioinformatics) I wondered when, or whether the protein folding problem might be solved, or atleast approximated sufficiently well. Turns out that today, exactly this may have happened, according to *Deep Mind* and the article in *Nature* [1].
