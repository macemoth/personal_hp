*This post represent my personal opinion. I do not intent to attack any of the mentioned organisations or countries.*

As a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2, YouTube's ad revenues have almost halved in the first half of 2020 [1]. Although this will not put YouTube or its parent Alphabet into a liquidity crisis, it is a taste of a phenomenon that could be seen more frequently in the future.

In 2018, long before the pandemic, another event occured that was going to have, although more modest consequences in the year 2020: the social network TikTok operated by the Chinese company ByteDance was made largely available outside of China [2]. Since this year, one can certainly consider TikTok as precedence case for a foreign-operated social network that is successful in the United States and other western countries.

What has this to do with YouTube? The video sharing platform is in a delicate situation, although concealed by the massive capital reserves: YouTube earns its money mainly by selling advertisement on videos. The more users are presented the advertisements, the more appealing YouTube becomes as advertising platform. Finally, content creators contribute to a large part of YouTube's video library that attract users, provide financial gain to YouTube and are compensated. The compensation is sufficient that some content creators can finance their lifestyles comfortably.

In this view, every platform operating in such an environment has to deal with three external parties: (a) their users, (b) their advertisers and (c) the content creators. The peculiar situation is: In case one parties contribution diminishes, it has trouble keeping the other parties interested. Consider the following situation: half of the content creators decide to move away from YouTube. Users are missing content, visit the platform more seldom and advertising becomes less attractive. YouTube has different regulators to modify the cashflow between those parties, such as augmenting the ad price, for example. Of course, modifying one regulator has consequences, on the parties, as a higher ad price must be justified by an adequate number of users or attractiveness of ads.

The imbalance of this trilemma caused by less income from advertisers the first half of 2020 was answered from YouTube by increasing the amount of advertisements. In short term, such a change provides more income, in exchange of less acceptance by users. As a consequence, ad attractiveness decreases and the current advertisement prices become slightly less legitimate, which could make YouTube less attractive for advertisers. The circular fashion of the structure should be clear by now.

The current situation YouTube is facing is probably not critical enough to bring trouble to YouTube but is an example of how fragile the underlying mechanics of such a platform is. YouTube's business model is more risky than what one would intuitively expect.

Chinese companies have shown to reproduce existent business models capably. Examples include Baidu (although having some shared history to Google), Alibaba, Huawei, and most recently, TikTok. By state backing, many Chinese companies can subsist a longer time until becoming profitable compared to most western companies. They are also skilled in utilising technologies and have expertise in implementing internet platforms, as they have demonstrated recently. How long would it take them to popularise a video- or streaming platform internationally?

Thus, I claim that TikTok is not the last Chinese internet portal adopting a non-only Chinese user base and perhaps displace one or another US-American platform. For China, exporting internet platforms replaces the incoming cash from being world's factory suitably, given that many countries consider to relocate production capacities back to domestic ground. And in contrast to exporting services and goods to foreign companies, individual foreign users have less regulatory or legal constraints.
