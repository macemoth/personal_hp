For a recent group project, 3D models of virus capsids were required. The group project comprises a Microbiology- and Chemistry themed game. As CryoEM or X-Ray structures can be rendered in a very aesthetic manner, a more performance-trimmed way has to be chosen for a game containing many virus elements. Hence, I designed virus capsids using *Blender* which are scientifically inaccurate, but should work well for a game. A few examples of the rendered structures are displayed here.
